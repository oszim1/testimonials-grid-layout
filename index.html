      <p class="bold">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
      <p class="regular">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled short thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

The program gave me the confidence necessary ti be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people"</p>

      <p class="bold">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
      <p class="regular">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculumand staff did not disappoing. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development expecience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
